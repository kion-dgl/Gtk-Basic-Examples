# Gtk 3.0 Tutorial

This is a clone of the original GTK 2.0, which can be found [here](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/stable/). I believe that tutorials like this are important for more
developers and new comers to become familiar with GTK and Linux programming in general. 

Original tutorial by:
Tony Gale, Ian Main & the GTK team

Gtk 3.0 port by:
Benjamin Collins (kion)
